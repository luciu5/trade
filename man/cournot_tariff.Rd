\arguments{
\item{prices}{A length k vector product prices.}

\item{quantities}{An n x k matrix of product quantities. All quantities must either be positive, or if the product is
not produced by a plant, NA}

\item{margins}{An n x k matrix of product margins. All margins must be either be between 0 and 1, or NA.}

\item{demand}{A length k character vector equal to "linear" if a product's demand curve is assumed to be linear or "log"
if a product's demand curve is assumed to be log-linear.}

\item{cost}{A length k character vector equal to "linear" if a plant's marginal cost curve is assumed to be linear or
"constant" if a plant's marginal curve is assumed to be constant. Returns an error if a multi-plant firm with constant
 marginal costs does not have capacity constraints.}

\item{tariffPre}{An n x k matrix  where each element equals the \strong{current } \emph{ad valorem} tariff (expressed as a proportion of consumer price) imposed
on each product. Default is 0, which assumes no tariff.}

\item{tariffPost}{An n x k matrix  where each element equals the \strong{new}  \emph{ad valorem} tariff (expressed as a proportion of consumer price) imposed
on each product. Default is 0, which assumes no tariff.}

\item{mcfunPre}{a length n list of functions that calculate a plant's  marginal cost under the current tariff structure.
If empty (the default), assumes quadratic costs.}

\item{mcfunPost}{a length n list of functions that calculate a plant's marginal cost under the new tariff structure.
If empty (the default), assumes quadratic costs.}

\item{vcfunPre}{a length n list of functions that calculate a plant's  variable cost under the current tariff structure.
If empty (the default), assumes quadratic costs.}

\item{vcfunPost}{a length n list of functions that calculate a plant's variable cost under the new tariff structure.
If empty (the default), assumes quadratic costs.}

\item{capacitiesPre}{A length n numeric vector of plant capacities under the current tariff regime. Default is Inf.}

\item{capacitiesPost}{A length n numeric vector of plant capacities under the new tariff regime. Default is Inf.}

\item{productsPre}{An n x k matrix that equals TRUE if under the current tariff regime, a plant produces a product. Default is TRUE if 'quantities' is not NA.}

\item{productsPost}{An n x k matrix that equals TRUE if under the new tariff regime, a plant produces a product. Default equals 'productsPre'.}

\item{owner}{EITHER a vector of length n whose values indicate which plants are commonly owned OR an n x n matrix of ownership shares.}

\item{mktElast}{A length k vector of product elasticities. Default is a length k vector of NAs}

\item{quantityStart}{A length k vector of quantities used as the initial guess in the nonlinear equation solver. Default is 'quantities'.}

\item{control.slopes}{A list of  \code{\link{optim}}  control parameters passed to the calibration routine optimizer
(typically the \code{calcSlopes} method).}

\item{control.equ}{A list of  \code{\link[BB]{BBsolve}} control parameters passed to the non-linear equation solver
(typically the \code{calcPrices} method).}

\item{labels}{A k-length vector of labels.}

\item{...}{Additional options to feed to the \code{\link[BB]{BBsolve}} optimizer used to solve for equilibrium quantities.}

\value{
\code{cournot_tariff} returns an instance of class \code{\linkS4class{Cournot}} from package \pkg{antitrust}, depending upon the value of the ``demand'' argument.

\description{
Simulate the effect of tariffs when firms play a cournot quantity setting game and consumer demand is either linear or log-linear
}
\details{
Let k denote the number of products and n denote the number of plants. Using price, and quantity, information for all products in each market, as well as
margin information for at least one products in each market, \code{cournot_tariff} is able to recover the
slopes and intercepts of either a Linear or Log-linear demand system. These parameters are then used
to simulate the price effects of a tariff under the assumption that the firms are playing a
homogeneous products simultaneous quantity setting game.
}
\examples{
## Simulate the effect of a 75\% ad valorem tariff in a
## 5-firm, single-product market with linear demand and quadratic costs
## Firm 1 is assumed to be foreign, and so subject to a tariff


n <- 5 #number of firms in market
cap <- rnorm(n,mean = .5, sd = .1)
int <- 10
slope <- -.25
tariffPre <- tariffPost <- rep(0, n)
tariffPost[1] <- .75

B.pre.c = matrix(slope,nrow=n,ncol=n)
diag(B.pre.c) = 2* diag(B.pre.c) - 1/cap
quantity.pre.c = rowSums(solve(B.pre.c) * -int)
price.pre.c = int + slope * sum(quantity.pre.c)
mc.pre.c = quantity.pre.c/cap
vc.pre.c = quantity.pre.c^2/(2*cap)
margin.pre.c = 1 - mc.pre.c/price.pre.c

#prep inputs for Cournot
owner.pre <- diag(n)



result.c <- cournot_tariff(prices = price.pre.c,quantities = as.matrix(quantity.pre.c),
                    margins=as.matrix(margin.pre.c),
                    owner=owner.pre,
                    tariffPre =  as.matrix(tariffPre),
                    tariffPost = as.matrix(tariffPost))

summary(result.c, market = TRUE)         # summarize tariff (high-level)
summary(result.c, market = FALSE)         # summarize tariff (detailed)
