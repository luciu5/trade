\arguments{
\item{demand}{A character vector indicating which demand system to use. Currently allows logit (default).}

\item{prices}{A length k vector product prices.}

\item{quantities}{A length k vector of product quantities.}

\item{margins}{A length k vector of product margins. All margins must be in \strong{levels} (not w.r.t to price), or NA.}

\item{owner}{EITHER a vector of length k whose values indicate which firm produced a product before the tariff OR a k x k matrix of pre-merger ownership shares.}

\item{mktElast}{A negative number equal to the industry pre-merger price elasticity. Default is NA .}

\item{diversions}{A k x k matrix of diversion ratios with diagonal elements equal to -1. Default is missing, in which case diversion according to revenue share is assumed.}

\item{tariffPre}{A vector of length k where each element equals the \strong{current} \emph{ad valorem} tariff
(expressed as a proportion of the consumer price) imposed on each product. Default is 0, which assumes no tariff.}

\item{tariffPost}{A vector of length k where each element equals the \strong{new}  \emph{ad valorem} tariff
(expressed as a proportion of the consumer price) imposed on each product. Default is 0, which assumes no tariff.}

\item{priceStart}{For aids, a vector of length k who elements equal to an initial guess of the proportional change in price caused by the merger.
The default is to draw k random elements from a [0,1] uniform distribution. For ces and logit, the default is prices.}

\item{parmStart}{\code{aids} only. A vector of length 2 whose elements equal to an initial guess for each "known" element of the diagonal of the demand matrix and the market elasticity.}

\item{control.slopes}{A list of  \code{\link{optim}}  control parameters passed to the calibration routine optimizer (typically the \code{calcSlopes} method).}

\item{control.equ}{A list of  \code{\link[BB]{BBsolve}} control parameters passed to the non-linear equation solver (typically the \code{calcPrices} method).}

\item{labels}{A k-length vector of labels.}

\item{...}{Additional options to feed to the \code{\link[BB]{BBsolve}} optimizer used to solve for equilibrium prices.}

\description{
Simulate the effect of tariffs when firms play a second score procurement auction game and consumer demand is Logit.
}
\details{
Let k denote the number of products produced by all firms.
Using price, and quantity, information for all products
in each market, as well as margin information for at least
one products in each market, \code{auction2ndtariff} is able to
recover the slopes and intercepts of a Logit, CES, demand
system. These parameters are then used to simulate the price
effects of an \emph{ad valorem} tariff under the assumption that the firms are playing a
2nd score auction.
